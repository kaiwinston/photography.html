<p>I chose this image and edited it the way I did since it reminded me of one of my moms favorite albums, Yankee Hotel Foxtrot (Wilco, 2003). If you haven’t listened to it yet, I’d highly recommend it. The cut off building and sky immediately reminded me of this album cover so I added a faded and beige camera filter-- along with kicking up the exposure and adding a directional fade to put my own little touch on it. I also heavily reduced the black point and cranked up the contrast. I thought the reflection off the glass panes on the building really complimented it as well.
